LIBDVB - DVB library for SI parsing, OSD, tuning, ...

There are 8 example programs that show how to work with the library. 
You can also look at the tuxzap package for further usage
information. 

conv
converts from one of the various input formats (xml, satcodx, nokia)
to the libdvb format.

satscan
shows how to scan the transponders of a satellite for new channels.
It will scan all the transpnders it reads from a dvbrc file.

quickscan
scans the currently tuned transponder

cam_test
can tune channels from a given or default dvbrc, communicate with
cam_set to use the CAM, output a TS or PS and videotext information,
see -h option for details.

cam_set
is a server like program to communicate with the cam. It uses sockets
to receive commands from and transfer data to other programs like
cam_test and cam_menu 

cam_menu
is an example on how to query menus from cam_set

status_check
gives a quick view of the tuning status

merge
will merge dvbrc files and eliminate duplicate channels.


I added the ci stack from the vdr program and put it into a separate
library. There is also a test program for running the ci handler and a
program that calls the handler program. (cam_set, cam_test)


To build the libs and programs just type make.


DVBRC format
The dvbrc format has entries for Satellites, LNBs, transponders and
channels. The configuration for one transponder on Astra (19deg E)
using an universal LNB is:

LNB ID 0 TYPE 1  LOF1 9750000 LOF2 10600000 SLOF 11700000 DISEQCNR 0
  SAT ID 192 NAME "Astra" LNBID 0 FMIN 10700000 FMAX 12700000
    TRANSPONDER ID 0018 TSID 04d5 SATID 0192 TYPE 0 FREQ 11568000 POL V SRATE 22      
	CHANNEL ID 0 NAME "Al Jazeera" SATID 192 TPID 18 SID 233d TYPE 0 VPID 37 APID 38 TTPID 1496 PCRPID 37


The ID tags for LNB, SAT, TRANSPONDER and CHANNEL are more or less
arbitrary, you just have to know them so that the channel can be
connected to a Transponder via the TSID tag, a transponder can be
connected to a satellite via the SATID tag and the satellite can be
connected to the LNB via the LNBID tag.
The other tags have the following meaning:
LNB: 
	TYPE		not used at the moment
	LOF1 LNB 	offset 1
	LOF2 LNB 	offset 2
	SLOF 		switching frequency for offset
	DISEQNR 	diseqc number of LNB 

SAT:
	NAME            Name of the Satellite
	LNBID		ID of the LNB pointing to the satellite
	FMIN		minimum transponder frequency
	FMAX		maximum transponder frequency

TRANSPONDER:
	TSID		
	SATID		ID of the satellite the transponder is on
	TYPE		0 for satellite, 1 for cable, 2 for terrestial
	FREQ		transponder frequency
	POL		polarisation (V or H)
	SRATE		symbol rate

CHANNEL:
	NAME		channel name
